Google Music Growl Notifications for Chrome
===========================================

I really like getting growl notifications of new tracks being played and I really missed this feature when I started to use Google Music over iTunes. I wrote an NPAPI browser plugin to create a javascript->Growl bridge which you can find [here](https://github.com/nletourneau/JSGrowl), this extension uses that in order to send everything off.

Big thanks to [asavartsov](https://github.com/asavartsov) for the [cloudplayer-scrobbler](https://github.com/asavartsov/cloudplayer-scrobbler/tree/google-music) source which I hacked up to use here, saved me a lot of time.
